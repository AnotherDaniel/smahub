# Home Assistant Sensor Generator Plugin

The Home Assistant Sensor Generator plugin is a SMAHub sink plugin that generates Home Assistant sensor configuration files for SMA devices. This plugin is useful for users who want to easily generate configuration files for their Home Assistant instances to monitor their SMA devices.

## Configuration

The configuration file for the Home Assistant Sensor Generator plugin is located in the `config` directory and has the following format:

```ini
[plugin]
enabled = false

[generator]
generate_freq = 10
filename_prefix = "hasensors_"

[icons]
SHM2 = "mdi:camera-switch"
TriPowerX = "mdi:border-all"
```

To enable the Home Assistant Sensor Generator plugin, set `enabled` to `true`. Update the `generate_freq` value to set the frequency (in seconds) at which the plugin generates the sensor configuration files. The `filename_prefix` field determines the prefix for the generated configuration files.

In the `[icons]` section, you can define icons for each device type. The key should match the first part of the SMA data key, and the value should be the desired icon.

## Environment Variables

The Home Assistant Sensor Generator plugin can also be configured using the following environment variables:

- `GENHASENSORS_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable the plugin.
- `GENHASENSORS_GENERATEFREQ`: The frequency (in seconds) at which the plugin generates sensor configuration files.
- `GENHASENSORS_FILEPREFIX`: The prefix for the generated configuration files.

For each icon defined in the `[icons]` section, you can also set an environment variable with the format `GENHASENSORS_<ICON_KEY>`, where `<ICON_KEY>` is the uppercase version of the icon key in the configuration file.

## How It Works

The Home Assistant Sensor Generator plugin iterates through the SMA data dictionary and identifies unique device types based on the first part of the SMA data keys. For each device type, the plugin generates a Home Assistant sensor configuration file with a name in the format `<filename_prefix><device_type>.yaml`.

The generated configuration files contain the sensor definitions for each data key associated with the device type. The SMA data keys are converted to Home Assistant sensor names by replacing periods (.) with underscores (_). The state topics for the sensors are derived from the SMA data keys by replacing periods (.) with slashes (/).

If an icon is defined for a device type in the `[icons]` section of the configuration file, the generated sensor configuration will include the icon. Home Assistant uses the [Material Design Icon set](https://materialdesignicons.com).
If a value in the SMA data dictionary is a tuple, the second element of the tuple is used as the unit of measurement for the sensor.

When the plugin is running, it will generate the sensor configuration files at the configured frequency. You can then import these files into your Home Assistant instance to monitor the SMA devices in real-time.
