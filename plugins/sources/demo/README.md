# Demo Source Plugin

The demo source plugin is a simple example of a SMAHub source plugin. It generates a sequence of numbers at regular intervals and provides these numbers as SMA data. This plugin is useful for testing and understanding how the SMAHub plugins work.

## Configuration

The configuration file for the demo source plugin is located in the `config` directory and has the following format:

```ini
[plugin]
enabled = false

[content]
message = "Hello, world!"
```

To enable the demo source plugin, set `enabled` to `true`.

## Environment Variables

The demo source plugin can also be enabled using the environment variable `DEMOSOURCE_ENABLED`. Set it to `true` to enable the plugin.

## How It Works

The demo source plugin generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increments it every 5 seconds. The plugin adds the current number to SMA data under the key `demoValue`.

When the plugin is enabled, you should see output similar to the following in the console:

```console
Hello, world!
```

This output indicates that the demo source plugin is running and generating SMA data correctly. Other plugins can now access the `demoValue` key in the SMA data to retrieve the current number generated by the demo source plugin.
